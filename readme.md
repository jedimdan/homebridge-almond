Almond+ Platform plugin for the amazing [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) project.

Currently only support binary switches, with more coming later.

# Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g pablopoo/homebridge-almond`
3. Update your configuration file. See the sample below.

# Configuration

Configuration sample:

This uses the Almond+ [websocket API](https://wiki.securifi.com/index.php/Websockets_Documentation#Devicelist) so you need to be running at least R89 firmware.

Then add this to your homebridge config.json (updating the password).

 ```javascript
    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "Almond",
            "name": "Almond Platform",
            "host":"10.10.10.254",
            "port": "7681",
            "username": "root",
            "password": "frank"
        }
    ]
```
